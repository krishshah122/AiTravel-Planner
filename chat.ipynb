       "\"Published: 2018-07-02\\nTitle: The Matrix Calculus You Need For Deep Learning\\nAuthors: Terence Parr, Jeremy Howard\\nSummary: This paper is an attempt to explain all the matrix calculus you need in order\\nto understand the training of deep neural networks. We assume no math knowledge\\nbeyond what you learned in calculus 1, and provide links to help you refresh\\nthe necessary math where needed. Note that you do not need to understand this\\nmaterial before you start learning to train and use deep learning in practice;\\nrather, this material is for those who are already familiar with the basics of\\nneural networks, and wish to deepen their understanding of the underlying math.\\nDon't worry if you get stuck at some point along the way---just go back and\\nreread the previous section, and try writing down and working through some\\nexamples. And if you're still stuck, we're happy to answer your questions in\\nthe Theory category at forums.fast.ai. Note: There is a reference section at\\nthe end of the paper summarizing all the key matrix calculus rules and\\nterminology discussed here. See related articles at http://explained.ai\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-24\\nTitle: On maximizing the number of heads when you need to set aside at least one coin every round\\nAuthors: Wouter van Doorn\\nSummary: You play the following game: you start out with $n$ coins that all have\\nprobability $p$ to land heads. You toss all of them and you then need to set\\naside at least one of them, which will not be tossed again. Now you repeat the\\nprocess with the remaining coins. This continues (for at most $n$ rounds) until\\nall coins have been set aside. Your goal is to maximize the total number of\\nheads you end up with. In this paper we will prove that there exists a constant\\n$p_0 \\\\approx 0.5495021777642$ such that, if $p_0 < p \\\\le 1$ and the number of\\nremaining coins is large enough, then it is optimal to set aside exactly one\\ncoin every round, unless all coins landed heads. When $\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\le p \\\\le\\np_0$, it is optimal to set aside exactly one coin every round, unless at most\\none coin came up tails. Let $v_{n,p}$ be the expected number of heads you\\nobtain when using the optimal strategy. We will show that $v_{n,p}$ is larger\\nthan or equal to $v_{n-1,p} + 1$ for all $n \\\\ge 3$ and all $p \\\\ge \\\\frac{1}{2}$.\\nWhen $p < \\\\frac{1}{2}$ there are infinitely many $n$ for which this inequality\\ndoes not hold. Finally, we will see that for every $p$ with $0 < p \\\\le 1$ the\\nsequence $n - v_{n,p}$ is convergent.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-08-29\\nTitle: PyCSP3: Modeling Combinatorial Constrained Problems in Python\\nAuthors: Christophe Lecoutre, Nicolas Szczepanski\\nSummary: In this document, we introduce PyCSP$3$, a Python library that allows us to\\nwrite models of combinatorial constrained problems in a declarative manner.\\nCurrently, with PyCSP$3$, you can write models of constraint satisfaction and\\noptimization problems. More specifically, you can build CSP (Constraint\\nSatisfaction Problem) and COP (Constraint Optimization Problem) models.\\nImportantly, there is a complete separation between the modeling and solving\\nphases: you write a model, you compile it (while providing some data) in order\\nto generate an XCSP$3$ instance (file), and you solve that problem instance by\\nmeans of a constraint solver. You can also directly pilot the solving procedure\\nin PyCSP$3$, possibly conducting an incremental solving strategy. In this\\ndocument, you will find all that you need to know about PyCSP$3$, with more\\nthan 50 illustrative models.\""
